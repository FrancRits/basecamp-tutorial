      "Minimal app with command and telemetry interfaces. It has two commands that by convention ",
      "are part of every  app. The 'No Operation(NOOP)' commands sends an event message with the ",
      "app's version number. The Reset app command resets the app to a known state. Historially ",
      "this command only reset counters. The Basecamp convention is to reset any status or state ",
      "that makes sens for the app. The app has one telemetry message that by convention is called ",
      "the 'Housekeeping' message. This message is sent in response to an onboard scheduling message ",
      "that is sent by the Scheduler App. It contains status information that includes command ",
      "valid and invalid counters. This app uses the Basecamp C Application Framework. This framework ",
      "is object-based and uses design patterns to allow developers to create consistent app designs ",
      "that are robust and easy to maintain. A common app component is the initialization parameter ",
      "file. This is a JSON file that is read when an app initializes and contains parameters that ",
      "can be defined at runtime"
